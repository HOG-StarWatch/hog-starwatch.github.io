## **‘Demihuman-半人’:**

Demihuman, or ‘Demi’, is a slang term primarily used by humans in the Kriterran empire to refer to ‘halfbreeds’ with a non-human parent. Because the humans of Kriterra are able to crossbreed with other races with relative ease, demis are fairly common in the cities of the empire. ‘Demi’ is a derisive, insulting term to imply that these half-breeds are ‘less than human’, and is most often used in communities rife with racial conflict to demean those that bridge the gap. In polite society the appropriate term to classify a ‘halfbreed’ would be to call them ‘half-elf’ or ‘half-zev’, acknowledging the source of their non-human ancestry.

Demihuman，或“Demi”，是一个俚语，主要由 Kriterran 帝国的人类使用，指的是具有非人类父母的“混血儿”。因为 Kriterra 的人类能够相对容易地与其他种族杂交，所以 demis 在帝国的城市中相当普遍。“Demi”是一个嘲笑、侮辱性的词，暗示这些混血儿“不如人类”，最常用于充满种族冲突的社区，以贬低那些弥合差距的人。在礼貌社会中，对“混血儿”进行分类的合适术语是称他们为“半精灵”或“半泽夫”，承认他们非人类血统的来源。

## **‘Magical Beasts-魔法野兽’:**

A magical beast or creature can, at a glance, appear very similar to any normal animal. The main way to differentiate them is that magical beasts have a much higher natural reserve of mana compared to a standard animal. Magical beasts are often the result of experiments by mages to create chimeric creatures, though they can be the natural result of mana corruption.

一眼看去，魔法野兽或生物看起来与任何普通动物都非常相似。区分它们的主要方法是，与标准动物相比，魔法野兽具有更高的自然法力储备。魔法野兽通常是法师实验创造嵌合生物的结果，尽管它们可能是法术力腐化的自然结果。

## **‘Mana and Mana Corruption**-玛娜(魔力 法力)和玛娜腐化**’:**

Mana is the essence of life itself, and the flow of mana through the body is important to the body’s health and natural functions. Mana naturally flows out of the body through everyday activities and, in most living beings, mana is primarily replenished through the intake of food and drink. Mana is also passively absorbed from the environment at a slower rate. Mages can use the mana in their bodies or the surrounding environment to create various effects. Because use of mana through natural means is typically inefficient, Mages throughout history have created various tools and foci to refine the use of mana to achieve their desired effects without draining their own reserves too greatly. A typical catalyst, for example, has a mana-imbued gemstone upon it from which the mage can augment their reserves when casting a spell.

玛娜是生命本身的本质，玛娜在体内的流动对身体的健康和自然功能很重要。玛娜通过日常活动自然流出体外，在大多数生物中，玛娜主要通过摄入食物和饮料来补充。玛娜也会以较慢的速度被动地从环境中吸收。法师可以使用他们体内或周围环境中的玛娜来创造各种效果。因为通过自然方式使用玛娜通常是低效的，所以历史上的法师们创造了各种工具和焦点来改进玛娜的使用，以达到他们想要的效果，而不会过多地消耗他们自己的储备。例如，一个典型的催化剂上有一颗充满玛娜的宝石，法师可以在施放法术时从中增加他们的储备。

Mana corruption is a condition which occurs when the natural flow of mana to the body is heavily disrupted. This can be caused by a mage overusing their magic until their flow of mana all but ceases, causing mana stagnation which typically results in a coma. There is, however, a more insidious form of mana corruption; that which results when a living being is subject to a flow of highly concentrated ambient mana. This can corrupt the ‘essence’ of a living being, often resulting in a slow and agonizing death. In some cases the victim of mana corruption will survive the effects but their body will be permanently changed as a result. Mana corruption from the fallout of the Great War is said to be the origin of many magical beasts that still trouble the woods and borderlands of the Kriterran Empire to this day.

玛娜腐化是当玛娜自然流向身体的流量被严重破坏时发生的一种情况。这可能是由于法师过度使用他们的魔法直到他们的玛娜流动几乎停止，导致玛娜停滞，这通常会导致昏迷。然而，还有一种更阴险的玛娜腐化形式;当生物受到高度集中的环境玛娜流动的影响时，结果会发生变化。这会腐蚀生物的“本质”，通常会导致缓慢而痛苦的死亡。在某些情况下，玛娜腐化的受害者会在效果中幸存下来，但他们的身体会因此而永久改变。据说第一次世界大战余波造成的玛娜腐蚀是许多魔法野兽的起源，这些野兽至今仍困扰着克里特兰帝国的树林和边境地区。
