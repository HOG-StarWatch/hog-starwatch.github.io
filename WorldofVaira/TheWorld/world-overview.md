## The World-世界

Everyone knows the world is flat. Or, more precisely, it’s in a shape of concave disc held firmly by the hand of goddess Vaira, who uses it as a goblet for drinking water.

每个人都知道世界是平的。或者，更准确地说，它是凹盘的形状，由女神 Vaira(瓦拉) 的手牢牢握住，她将其用作饮用水的高脚杯。

Or at least that’s what the legends say. How true is it? The only ones that know for sure are the adventurers who got carried by The Flow and fell down into the abyss. And they’re not able to tell tales.

或者至少传说是这么说的。这是真的吗？唯一确定的是那些被 The Flow(湍流瀑布) 带走并坠入深渊的冒险者。而且他们不会讲故事。

## GEOGRAPHY: Kriterra-地理位置：克里特拉

### **Northern Empire**-帝国北境

The lands of the north are split in two by the Great Basin river, which originates as a tributary of the Flow in northern Kriterra and then flows into the Great Basin near the center of the continent. The Great Basin river is the lifeblood of the empire, with the Imperial Capital straddling it near the mouth of the flow and almost every major city in the northern Empire situated near the river or one of its tributaries. The northern side of the river tends to be more rugged and hilly terrain with grasslands roamed by grazing herds of sheep, though the occasional wind-sheltered valley supports a larger city here and there. To the south the gentler terrain supports woodlands and large farming communities. Closer to central Kriterra rises Mount Aria, which blocks access to the shores of the Flow until one passes through to the forests of the south.

北部的土地被大盆地河一分为二，大盆地河发源于克里特拉北部的一条流，然后流入大陆中心附近的大盆地。大盆地河是帝国的命脉，帝都横跨在河口附近，帝国北部的几乎所有主要城市都位于河流或其支流之一附近。河流的北侧往往是更崎岖的丘陵地形，草原上放牧着成群的羊，尽管偶尔有避风的山谷在这里和那里支持着一个更大的城市。南部较平缓的地形支持林地和大型农业社区。靠近 Kriterra 中心的地方耸立着 Aria 山，它阻碍了通往 The Flow 海岸的通道，直到穿过南部的森林。

### **Southern Empire**-帝国南部

The southern provinces of the Empire are viewed by some as a ‘backwater’. In truth, much of these lands are all but uninhabited. A few cities dot the shores of the Flow, and there are High Elf villages scattered around the forests, but the majority of Kriterran citizenry avoid the area. What few settlers try to develop the lands often end up vanishing for one reason or another. The forests are rife with bandits and local forces are only able to patrol in the immediate vicinity of the cities and major trade routes. There are also tales, as far fetched as they might be, that the woods are haunted, and the trees themselves rebuke any who attempt to clear land in the south.

帝国的南部省份被一些人视为“死水”。事实上，这些土地中的大部分几乎无人居住。一些城市点缀着 The Flow 的海岸，森林周围散布着高等精灵村庄，但大多数 Kriterran 公民都避开该地区。少数定居者试图开发这些土地的东西往往因为这样或那样的原因而最终消失了。森林里到处都是土匪，当地部队只能在城市和主要贸易路线附近巡逻。还有一些故事，尽管可能牵强附会，但树林闹鬼，树木本身会斥责任何试图在南方开垦土地的人。

### **Academy**-学院

Situated in the center of Kriterra, near the Great Basin lake, is the Academy of Kriterra. The school is situated on a hill on the northwest side of the lake, with forests to the south, the Great Basin River to the east, and rolling hills to the north. The nearest city is upriver from the Academy about a week’s journey on foot. This is in part due to the thought that, if anything were to go wrong at the Academy, it would be safely isolated from major population centers.This has lead to a sort of ‘academy village’ springing up around the school itself, however, to cater to various needs the students and teachers might have.

位于 Kriterra 中心，靠近大盆地湖的是 Kriterra 学院。学校位于湖西北侧的一座小山上，南面是森林，东面是大盆地河，北面是连绵起伏的丘陵。最近的城市位于学院的上游，步行大约需要一周的路程。这部分是由于这样一种想法，即如果学院出现任何问题，它将安全地与主要人口中心隔离开来。然而，这导致了一种 “学院村 ”在学校周围涌现，以满足学生和教师可能有的各种需求。

## GEOGRAPHY: Apteros-地理位置：阿普特罗斯

### **Al-Nhamli**-艾纳姆莉

The Great Desert of Al-Nhamli is the largest single geographic feature in all of Apteros, made up primarily of shifting sand dunes gradually moving eastward with the winds blown in from the Flow. The sand itself is deposited by the Flow on Al-Nhamli’s western shores, the ebb and flow of the great river depositing new sediment daily. The city of Nham is situated on a small plateau and built around an oasis in the desert, a rare stable water source in Al-Nhamli, though the city’s growth has required the people of Nham to import fresh water from the coast through a network of trading villages. To the south the desert slowly shifts into savannah and scrubland as it transitions into the Steel Plains, whereas the northern side of the desert is full of rugged hills leading into the steep mountains of Hellgate.

Al-Nhamli 大沙漠是整个 Apteros 中最大的单一地理特征，主要由移动的沙丘组成，随着气流吹来的风逐渐向东移动。沙子本身是由 Al-Nhamli 西岸的流动沉积的，这条大河的潮起潮落每天都会沉积新的沉积物。Nham 市位于一个小高原上，围绕着沙漠中的一片绿洲而建，这是 Al-Nhamli 罕见的稳定水源，尽管城市的发展要求 Nham 的人们通过贸易村庄网络从海岸进口淡水。在南部，沙漠在过渡到钢铁平原时慢慢转变为稀树草原和灌木丛，而沙漠的北侧则到处都是崎岖的丘陵，通向 Hellgate 的陡峭山脉。

### **Steel Plains**-钢铁平原

While the Steel Plains support more life than the Great Desert, they’re no less harsh an environment. The plains are mostly flat and dry, with tall grasses that make up the majority of the savannah. The plains are named for the so-called ‘Steelgrass’ that covers most of it, a hardy species of grass which can grow to the height of a man. The edges of these blades of grass are quite sharp and lined with barbs to dissuade herbivores from eating it. When Kriterran explorers first traveled the plains there were several instances of the men getting nasty cuts from the plants and thus their name was coined. These plains are grazed by herd animals such as antelope that migrate across the region seeking fresh water and plant life more amenable to being eaten. On the eastern edge of the plains the savannah gives way to light forest, marking the border of the Deepwoods. Farther to the south are the cliffs of Vaira’s Bowl.

虽然钢铁平原比大沙漠支持更多的生命，但它们的环境同样恶劣。平原大多平坦干燥，高草占据了大草原的大部分。平原以覆盖大部分地区的所谓“钢草”命名，这是一种耐寒的草种，可以长到一个人的高度。这些草叶的边缘非常锋利，并衬有倒钩以阻止食草动物食用它。当 Kriterran 探险家第一次旅行平原时，有几次男人从植物上被严重割伤，因此他们的名字被创造了。这些平原上是羚羊等群居动物的食草，它们迁徙穿过该地区，寻找淡水和更适合被食用的植物。在平原的东部边缘，大草原让位于浅色森林，标志着深林的边界。再往南是 Vaira's Bowl 的悬崖。

### **Deepwoods**-深黑森林

Southeastern Apteros is dominated by the deepwoods, a great forest of ancient trees that scrape the sky and create a canopy so thick that the forest floor is shrouded in darkness even during the brightest days. The Deepwood is struck by rainstorms regularly, allowing life to thrive in the region and the forests are home to uncountable species of animals adapted to the unique environment. The forest, like much of Apteros, is a good deal warmer than Kriterra. Where Al-Nhamli and the Steel Plains are dry and devoid of moisture, however, the Deepwoods are steeped in humidity. It is little wonder, then, that the majority of those who live there wear little if any clothing most of the time. Many goods traded in Kriterra are sourced, originally, from the Deepwoods, such as coffee and cocoa beans. A river branching off from the Flow reaches around the border between desert and Deepwoods before cascading off the edge of the Bowl to the east. This river is in Brighthearth territory, the Zev tribe most open to outsiders, and they maintain trade posts with both Nham and Kriterra on the river banks.

阿普特罗斯东南部以深林为主，这是一片由古树组成的大森林，它们刮擦天空并形成如此厚实的树冠，即使在最明亮的日子里，森林地面也笼罩在黑暗中。Deepwood 经常遭受暴雨袭击，使该地区的生命蓬勃发展，森林是无数适应独特环境的动物物种的家园。这片森林和阿普特罗斯的大部分地区一样，比克里特拉暖和得多。Al-Nhamli 和 Steel Plains 干燥且没有水分，然而，Deepwoods 则充满湿度。因此，难怪大多数住在那里的人大部分时间都很少穿衣服。在 Kriterra 交易的许多商品最初都来自 Deepwoods，例如咖啡和可可豆。一条从河流分叉出来的河流绕过沙漠和深林之间的边界，然后从碗的边缘向东倾泻而下。这条河位于 Brighthearth 领土上，这是 Zev 部落对外人最开放的地方，他们与河岸上的 Nham 和 Kriterra 都有贸易站。

### **Hellgate**-地狱之门(炼狱之门)

Even amongst the extreme conditions of Apteros, Hellgate is harsh beyond imagining. Originally known as the Dragonmaw Peaks, the mountainous north of Apteros was frigid and home to only the hardiest plants and animals, such as the mighty dragons. However, when the portal between Vaira and Hyirzm was opened, the subsequent cascade of mana to the region caused volcanic eruptions and lightning storms that swept the area. The mountains are now either bitterly cold or insufferably hot, depending on where one is looking, and regular lava flows and ash storms make travel in the area dangerous. There are still some stable routes through the mountains travelled either by the demons themselves, or the few brave merchants willing to peddle their wares to the natives of Hyirzm.

即使在 Apteros 的极端条件下，Hellgate 也非常严酷，超乎想象。阿普特罗斯北部的山区最初被称为龙喉峰，寒冷，只有最顽强的动植物栖息，例如强大的龙。然而，当 Vaira 和 Hyirzm 之间的门户打开时，随后的法力级联到该地区导致了火山喷发和雷暴，席卷了该地区。现在的山脉要么严寒，要么炎热得令人难以忍受，这取决于人们所看到的地方，定期的熔岩流和火山灰风暴使在该地区旅行变得危险。仍然有一些稳定的路线穿过山脉，要么是恶魔自己走的，要么是少数愿意向 Hyirzm 当地人兜售他们的商品的勇敢商人。

### **HEART OF VAIRA**-瓦拉之心

The middle of the disc is dominated by the mana crystal, its name varies from culture to culture, but people from Kriterra refer to it as the Heart of Vaira. It’s the source of magic power for the land, affecting both flora and fauna in unpredictable ways. The closer to the crystal, the more pronounced the effects are, but also more corrupted. Many animals close to the mana crystal were turned into monsters. Plants nearby are aggresive and grow out of control. Many wizards tried to directly harness the power of the mana, but declined into insanity.

圆盘的中间以玛娜水晶为主，它的名字因文化而异，但 Kriterra 的人们将其称为 Vaira 之心。它是这片土地的玛娜源泉，以不可预测的方式影响动植物。离水晶越近，效果就越明显，但也越腐败。许多靠近玛娜结晶的动物都变成了怪物。附近的植物具有侵略性，生长失控。许多巫师试图直接利用玛娜的力量，但都陷入了疯狂。

## **The Empire of Kriterra**-克里特拉帝国

Kriterran history is a fickle thing. Few records exist from before the founding of the empire due to a great calamity that struck the western continent, leaving much of the region’s history unclear, and open to interpretation. What can be agreed upon is that roughly 1200 years ago some event happened that all but wiped out ‘Old Kriterra’. 800 years ago the Empire of Kriterra was founded. Records from the time state that a council of kings were convened under the auspices of the Kingdom of Eliorecia, an Elven state on the southern shore of the Great Basin River. This council was called to put an end to the incessant territorial wars between the kingdoms founded since the collapse of Old Kriterra. The documents describe, in detail, the great wisdom of King Elorant the Third for attempting to head off another great conflict that could scourge the continent a second time.

Kriterran 的历史是变化无常的。由于一场袭击了西部大陆的大灾难，帝国成立之前的记录很少，该地区的大部分历史不清楚，有待解释。可以达成共识的是，大约 1200 年前发生了一些事件，几乎摧毁了“Old Kriterra”。800 年前，Kriterra 帝国成立。当时的记录表明，在大盆地河南岸的精灵国家埃利奥雷西亚王国的主持下召开了一次国王会议。召开这次会议是为了结束自旧克里斯特拉崩溃以来建立的王国之间无休止的领土战争。这些文件详细描述了伊洛兰特三世国王的伟大智慧，他试图阻止另一场可能再次席卷欧洲大陆的大冲突。

The summit resulted in the creation of the Council of Kings, precursor to the Empire itself, formed out of several small kingdoms near Eliorecia. There were, however, kingdoms that refused to see Elorant’s wisdom. The document goes into great detail about just how foolish and shortsighted the leaders of these nations were as well. While ostensibly a council created to avoid a war, the next century of Kriterran history dealt with the subjugation of these reticent kingdoms until, eventually, all of the Kriterran continent was unified. The Elves of the Forest Kingdom of Thelia would refuse to the last. Rather than be wiped out, many citizens of Thelia would escape into the dense forest and build small villages out of the reach of the Council, eventually becoming what are known today as ‘High Elves.’ The Council, having finished unifying the continent, would change its name to the Empire of Kriterra, posthumously naming Elorant as the first Emperor of Kriterra.

峰会导致了国王会议的成立，这是帝国本身的前身，由埃利奥雷西亚附近的几个小王国组成。然而，有些王国拒绝看到 Elorant 的智慧。该文件也非常详细地说明了这些国家的领导人是多么的愚蠢和短视。虽然表面上是为了避免战争而成立的委员会，但 Kriterran 历史的下一个世纪处理了这些沉默寡言的王国的征服，直到最终整个 Kriterran 大陆统一。Thelia 森林王国的精灵们会拒绝到最后。许多 Thelia 的公民并没有被消灭，而是逃进了茂密的森林，并在议会无法触及的地方建造了小村庄，最终成为今天被称为“高等精灵”的人。议会在完成对大陆的统一后，将更名为克里特拉帝国，追授埃洛兰特为克里特拉的第一任皇帝。

The Empire of Kriterra’s constitution was created the same day: An emperor would be elected by the council of kings to rule the nation and lead the council itself. The emperor is the greatest individual authority in the nation, but the council as a group can depose him if necessary. The first Emperor was an elf but the second to be elected was human. Ostensibly this was to show that the fledgling Empire was one of both men and elves, however it was more likely that this nomination was due to the balance of power within the council changing after Elorant’s death in battle.

克里特拉帝国的宪法在同一天制定：一位皇帝将由国王会议选出，以统治国家并领导议会本身。皇帝是国家中最大的个人权威，但如有必要，议会作为一个团体可以废黜他。第一位皇帝是精灵，但第二位被选出的皇帝是人类。表面上这是为了表明这个羽翼未丰的帝国是人类和精灵的一体，但更有可能的是，这个提名是由于 Elorant 在战斗中阵亡后议会内部的权力平衡发生了变化。

The Empire in modern days is a relatively cosmopolitan state, with most cities having a mix of various races, though the majority of the population is primarily human and elven, especially among the upper classes. While racial tensions flare up from time to time there is, ostensibly, a policy to treat any citizen of the Empire as equal, regardless of their origin.

现代帝国是一个相对国际化的国家，大多数城市都混合了各种种族，尽管大多数人口主要是人类和精灵，尤其是上层阶级。虽然种族紧张局势不时爆发，但表面上有一项政策，即平等对待帝国的任何公民，无论其出身如何。

Due to Kriterra’s size there are many regional differences within the empire, and each individual city has its own culture to some extent. The southern reaches of the continent, for example, are difficult to live in and the small cities that dot the coast are populated by hardened, pragmatic people. The capital, by contrast, is dominated by unspoken social rules about how one should dress, talk, and present themselves in public where one could easily ostracize themselves socially without even realizing it.

由于 Kriterra 的面积，帝国内部存在许多地区差异，每个城市在某种程度上都有自己的文化。例如，非洲大陆的南部地区很难居住，而沿海地区的小城市里住着顽固、务实的人们。相比之下，首都被不成文的社会规则所主导，这些规则关于一个人应该如何穿着、说话和在公共场合展示自己，人们很容易在社会上排斥自己，甚至没有意识到这一点。

### Slavery in the Empire-帝国的奴隶制

While ‘slavery’, in particular, is illegal within the Kriterran empire, there are various legal loopholes that have been exploited by wealthy merchants to further line their pockets. For example when one person is indebted to another it is allowed for the debtor to work as an indentured servant, provided they are given room and board, to pay off their debts. Cunning merchants will thus rope gullible individuals into signing contracts with clauses charging them exorbitant fees so as to put them into debt slavery. Such ‘slaves’ can be transferred from individual to individual by purchasing their debt. The tactic has been very effective with Zev tribespeople who aren’t accustomed to such trickery being offered passage to Kriterra only to find their exorbitant transport fees essentially mean they’ll be working off their debts for life.

虽然“奴隶制”在 Kriterran 帝国内部尤其非法，但富商们也利用了各种法律漏洞来进一步中饱私囊。例如，当一个人欠另一个人时，债务人可以作为契约仆人工作，前提是他们有食宿，以偿还债务。因此，狡猾的商人会诱使易受骗的人签订合同，其中的条款向他们收取高昂的费用，从而使他们成为债务奴隶。这样的“奴隶”可以通过购买他们的债务在个人之间转移。这种策略对不习惯这种诡计的 Zev 部落居民非常有效，他们被邀请前往 Kriterra，却发现他们高昂的运输费用基本上意味着他们将终生偿还债务。

------

## **The Academy**-学院

The Academy of Kriterra was founded a century after the Empire itself was, created as a place to collect the esoteric knowledge of magic from across the Empire, as well as to act as a policing body for mages and ensure dangerous spellcraft is kept in check.

克里斯特拉学院成立于帝国成立一个世纪后，旨在收集帝国各地深奥的魔法知识，同时也是法师的警务机构，确保危险的法术得到控制。

The Academy is, thus, almost a nation into itself, with its own laws and social norms. While ostensibly a school for magic alone, the Academy is also the greatest center of learning in all of the Empire and nobles from across Kriterra have their children apply to the entrance exam for admittance. It is considered very prestigious for an heir to be a graduate of the Academy, even if it is just for the ‘general education’ programs that lack any magical training.

因此，学院几乎是一个独立的国家，拥有自己的法律和社会规范。虽然表面上只是一所魔法学校，但学院也是整个帝国最大的学习中心，来自克里特拉各地的贵族都会让他们的孩子申请入学考试。继承人成为学院的毕业生被认为是非常有声望的，即使只是为了没有任何魔法训练的'通识教育'项目。

The Academy is located in central Kriterra, built on the shore of the Great Basin and nearby Mount Aria. To the Academy’s west is the so called ‘Slimy Forest’, which has been acting as a disposal ground for magical experiments for centuries. This forest also acts as the first step into the elven woods of southern Kriterra.

该学院位于克里斯特拉中部，建在大盆地岸边和附近的阿里亚山。学院的西边是所谓的“粘液之森”，几个世纪以来一直是魔法实验的处理场。这片森林也是进入 Kriterra 南部精灵森林的第一步。

![img](https://worldofvaira.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/slimy_transparent.png)

The Academy itself is a school campus the size of a city, having been expanded many times over the years. While the Academy is ostensibly located so far from other cities for the sake of isolation and safety, it hasn’t stopped a town from springing up around the Academy’s grounds to provide secondary services to students and staff, such as bakeries and clothing shops. The campus is split into sections with their own dormitories and classrooms, keeping the general studies and magical studies students largely isolated from each other.

学院本身是一个城市大小的校园，多年来已经扩建了多次。虽然为了隔离和安全，学院表面上远离其他城市，但它并没有阻止一个城镇在学院的场地周围涌现，为学生和教职员工提供二级服务，例如面包店和服装店。校园分为多个部分，有自己的宿舍和教室，使通识和魔法研究的学生在很大程度上彼此隔离。

While the general studies students are primarily from the nobility of Kriterra, the application to magical studies courses is much more rigorous. A prospective student must demonstrate a certain degree of magical proficiency and potential for development to be considered as a candidate. These entrance tests are performed in two steps: First a student typically sends in an application and, as part of it, must apply an enchantment to the parchment itself to prove basic competency. Should this application be accepted, an examiner will meet the applicant in person and put them through thorough testing to determine whether they would be a good fit for the Academy.

虽然通识课程的学生主要来自 Kriterra 的贵族，但魔法研究课程的应用要严格得多。未来的学生必须表现出一定程度的魔法熟练程度和发展潜力才能被视为候选人。这些入学测试分两个步骤进行：首先，学生通常会提交一份申请，作为申请的一部分，必须对羊皮纸本身施加附魔以证明基本能力。如果此申请被接受，审查员将亲自与申请人会面并对其进行全面测试，以确定他们是否适合学院。

Due to this rigorous process most cities have their own minor schools of magic, or magic tutors, willing to sell their services to those who have failed the entrance exam or, perhaps, wish to practice in advance for better chances of entry.

由于这个严格的过程，大多数城市都有自己的小型魔法学校或魔法导师，愿意向那些未通过入学考试的人出售他们的服务，或者，也许希望提前练习以获得更好的入学机会。

The teachers of the Academy are no less strictly tested, with most being considered masters of their prospective field. The current headmaster, Shay, for example, is considered the world’s foremost expert on evocation magic.

学院的教师同样受到严格的测试，大多数人被认为是他们未来领域的大师。例如，现任校长 Shay 被认为是世界上最重要的召唤魔法专家。

## **Nham**-纳姆

The desert city of Nham is the largest city in all of Vaira, which is especially impressive when one considers the harsh landscape around the city walls. However, the city has been built up over millenia into the international trading hub it exists as today. Unlike Kriterran history, the history of Nham is well kept and recorded both in city records as well as in the ledgers of merchants.

沙漠城市 Nham 是瓦伊拉最大的城市，考虑到城墙周围严酷的景观，这一点尤其令人印象深刻。然而，这座城市经过数千年的发展已成为今天的国际贸易中心。与 Kriterran 的历史不同，Nham 的历史保存完好，并记录在城市记录和商人的账簿中。

Nham was originally a small settlement founded around an oasis atop a stable plateau in the ever-shifting sands of the Al-Nhamli desert. This settlement was named after the Nham tribe who dwelled there. Unlike most Dunesmen tribes, they stayed in one place, rather than migrating across the desert in search of water and food or ‘walking with the rain’ as their people call it. Due to the nature of Dunesmen tribes, the settlement would likely have stayed a small tribal village for centuries if not for the sudden influx of human settlers on the shores of Al-Nhamli.

Nham 最初是一个小型定居点，围绕着 Al-Nhamli 沙漠不断流淌的沙子中稳定高原上的一片绿洲而建立。这个定居点以居住在那里的 Nham 部落命名。与大多数沙丘人部落不同，他们住在一个地方，而不是穿越沙漠迁移寻找水和食物，或者像他们的人民所说的“与雨同行”。由于沙丘部落的性质，如果不是因为人类定居者突然涌入 Al-Nhamli 海岸，该定居点可能会保持一个小型部落村庄几个世纪。

These human refugees from Kriterra had managed to survive the journey across the Flow. Luckily for them, the Dunesmen’s particular customs regarding hospitality and co-prosperity meant they didn’t have to face the hulking lizardmen in battle, and instead were taught ways to survive in the desert. While some of these human refugees went on to create their own nomadic tribes or integrate into existing Dunesmen ones, many of them made their way to Nham. The oasis was large enough to support the growing community with water, but food was still scarce. The human settlers, however, had knowledge of farming that the Dunesmen lacked. Soon irrigation channels were built and this farming community would support the new population.

这些来自 Kriterra 的人类难民设法在穿越 Kriterra 的旅程中幸存下来。对他们来说幸运的是，沙丘人在热情好客和共荣方面的特殊习俗意味着他们不必在战斗中面对笨重的蜥蜴人，而是被教导了在沙漠中生存的方法。虽然这些人类难民中的一些人继续创建自己的游牧部落或融入现有的沙丘人部落，但他们中的许多人还是来到了纳姆。这片绿洲足够大，可以用水来支持不断增长的社区，但食物仍然稀缺。然而，人类定居者拥有沙丘人所缺乏的农业知识。很快，灌溉渠道建成，这个农业社区将支持新的人口。

As Nham grew it would require more water and some of this was provided by the construction of a great aqueduct to redirect meltwater from the nearby Dragonmaw Peaks to Nham. With the city growing larger both from the human population growing as well as more Dunesmen tribes moving into the city, it would expand in a series of rings, eventually taking up the entire plateau. The Dunesmen customs encouraged trade between nomad groups and, despite the growth of the city, violent crime was surprisingly rare. Perhaps it was the heat of the desert discouraging wasted energy, or perhaps it was the Dunesmen customs rubbing off on the human residents, but disputes were, and still are, typically settled via bartering or ritual.

随着 Nham 的发展，它需要更多的水，其中一部分是通过建造一座大型渡槽提供的，该渡槽将融水从附近的 Dragonmaw Peaks 引向 Nham。随着人口的增长以及越来越多的沙丘人部落迁入城市，这座城市变得越来越大，它会以一系列的环状扩张，最终占据整个高原。沙丘人的习俗鼓励游牧民族之间的贸易，尽管城市发展壮大，但暴力犯罪却出奇地罕见。也许是沙漠的炎热阻止了能源的浪费，或者是沙丘人的习俗影响了人类居民，但争端过去和现在通常通过以物易物或仪式来解决。

For there was always one accepted form of conflict in Dunesmen culture: The Feast of Blood. The Feast is a form of ritual combat, sometimes to first blood, and sometimes to death, where Dunesmen would settle disputes too great for words, or simply to earn favor with potential mates. This yearly festival of sex and violence takes place during the Dunesmen’s mating cycle, where males becomes irritable and aggressive and females are, well, horny. Those who are weak of arm but possess great wealth can hire other males to fight on their behalf, and either strength of arm or strength of wallet are considered to be great indicators of a good mate for prospective females.

因为在沙丘人的文化中，总是有一种公认的冲突形式：血的盛宴。盛宴是一种仪式性的战斗形式，有时是第一滴血，有时是死亡，沙丘人会解决无法用言语表达的重大争端，或者只是为了赢得潜在伴侣的青睐。这个一年一度的性与暴力节发生在沙丘人的交配周期期间，雄性变得易怒和好斗，而雌性则变得好色。那些手臂虚弱但拥有巨大财富的人可以雇佣其他男性为他们战斗，手臂的力量或钱包的强度被认为是潜在女性好配偶的重要指标。

This custom has been integrated into the mixed culture of Nham, with The Feast of Blood being an annual gladiatorial battle in the city’s colosseum. However, since humans and other species living in Nham might have greater difficulty restraining their violent urges from day to day, there are smaller battles going on almost daily. Sometimes these battles are sponsored by the current Sultana as spectator events between seasoned warriors, and other times they are simply a way to settle disputes between shopkeepers. The stakes of the battles vary greatly, but the most intense events are always reserved for the yearly Feast.

这种习俗已经融入了 Nham 的混合文化中，血腥盛宴是该市罗马斗兽场一年一度的角斗士战斗。然而，由于生活在 Nham 的人类和其他物种可能每天都更难克制自己的暴力冲动，因此几乎每天都在进行较小的战斗。有时这些战斗是由现任 Sultana 赞助的，作为经验丰富的战士之间的观赏活动，有时它们只是解决店主之间纠纷的一种方式。战斗的赌注差异很大，但最激烈的事件总是留给一年一度的盛宴。

Because of the eclectic mix of cultures in Nham, there have been other changes to the custom of ritual combat. For example, it is considered an act of weakness to intentionally try and kill your opponent in battle. While deaths do occasionally occur, it’s the exception, rather than the rule. The colosseum holds great importance to the Royal Family, as well.

由于 Nham 的文化融合不拘一格，仪式性战斗的习俗也发生了其他变化。例如，在战斗中故意尝试杀死对手被认为是一种软弱的行为。虽然死亡确实偶尔发生，但这是例外，而不是规则。斗兽场对皇室也非常重要。

The ruler of Nham is always a Sultana. She does not marry, as she is considered to be the mother to her people. Instead, the royal lineage is continued by choosing a consort from amongst the warriors of the Feast, usually the winner of the contest. The consort holds as much authority as the Sultana decides to place in them, but whether the Sultana holds them in high esteem and treats them as their right hand, or whether they are only given one night with her, it is always considered a great honor to be chosen. This methodology of continuing the royal lineage has led to a royal family that supposedly shares the blood of every race on Vaira.

Nham 的统治者永远是 Sultana。她不结婚，因为她被认为是她人民的母亲。相反，皇室血统是通过从盛宴的战士中选择一个配偶来延续的，通常是比赛的获胜者。王妃拥有苏丹娜决定赋予他们的权力，但无论苏丹娜是高度尊重他们并将他们视为自己的左膀右臂，还是只给予他们与她共度一晚的机会，被选中总是被认为是一种莫大的荣幸。这种延续皇室血统的方法导致了一个据说与 Vaira 上每个种族共享血统的王室。

Because of the association with sex that has long been a part of the Feast it isn’t unusual for conflicts between warriors of the opposite gender in the arena to break down into fucking directly on the sands of the arena themselves, especially amongst the Zev tribes who send their young warriors to the colosseum to prove themselves. Since these ‘battles’ often prove even more popular than the ones that shed blood, it’s simply considered a form of ‘grappling’, and is allowed to go on until one party is unconscious or surrenders.

由于与性的联系长期以来一直是盛宴的一部分，竞技场中异性战士之间的冲突直接在竞技场的沙滩上爆发并不罕见，尤其是在将年轻战士送到罗马斗兽场证明自己的 Zev 部落中。由于这些 “战斗 ”往往比流血的 “战斗 ”更受欢迎，因此它被简单地认为是一种 “格斗 ”的形式，并被允许继续进行，直到一方失去知觉或投降。

## **Hellgate**-地狱之门(炼狱之门)

Hellgate refers to the outpost built up around the rift between the world of Vaira and Hyirzm, the homeland of the Dypal, or the ‘demons’, as they are commonly referred to across Vaira. Outsiders know very little of the world of Hyirzm, as the mana concentration is so high that should any native of Vaira try to cross its threshold they would almost certainly succumb to mana corruption. Thus, what knowledge exists is only that which demonkind has deigned to share.

Hellgate 是指围绕 Vaira 和 Hyirzm 世界之间的裂缝建立的前哨站，Hyirzm 是 Dypal 的故乡，或者说是 “恶魔”，他们在 Vaira 中通常被称为 “恶魔”。外人对 Hyirzm 的世界知之甚少，因为法力浓度如此之高，如果任何 Vaira 的当地人试图跨过它的门槛，他们几乎肯定会屈服于法力腐败。因此，存在的知识只是魔鬼屈尊分享的东西。

The world of Dypal is unlike that of Vaira, there exists only one, great landmass floating above an endless sea of clouds. There are only a few varieties of plants and animals, likely due to the lack of competition for resources, as the mana which suffuses the world provides the majority of the nourishment the beings who live there require. The Dypal are the only sentient race of their world, and all Dypal are citizens of the same kingdom, with the Demon Lord at the head of its dynasty.

Dypal 的世界与 Vaira 的世界不同，只有一个巨大的陆地漂浮在无尽的云海之上。植物和动物的种类很少，可能是由于缺乏对资源的竞争，因为弥漫在世界上的法力为生活在那里的生物提供了大部分营养。Dypal 是他们世界中唯一有知觉的种族，所有 Dypal 都是同一个王国的公民，恶魔领主是其王朝的首领。

The capital city of this kingdom is apparently majestic and massive in scope beyond any of the cities of Vaira, though no scholars native to Vaira would ever be able to see it and document it except, perhaps, the dwarves, if they deigned to take interest.

这个王国的首都显然是雄伟而广阔的，超出了瓦伊拉的任何城市，尽管没有瓦伊拉本地的学者能够看到和记录它，也许除了矮人，如果他们屈尊感兴趣的话。

Most of Vairan history with demonkind was that of war, specifically between the desert people of Nham and demonkind when the Hellgate first tore open. The world of Vaira is vastly different to their own, and the consumption of mana local to our world is both necessary for the Dypal to avoid starving while in Vaira, as well as a sort of euphoric pleasure to most Dypal. This mana ingestion can take the form of food, mana crystals, or even directly siphoning the mana from other living beings.

Vaira 与恶魔的大部分历史都是战争，特别是当炼狱之门第一次撕裂时，纳姆的沙漠人和恶魔之间的战争。Vaira 的世界与他们自己的世界大不相同，消耗我们世界当地的法力既是 Dypal 在 Vaira 中避免饥饿的必要条件，也是大多数 Dypal 的一种欣快乐趣。这种法力摄入可以采取食物、法力水晶的形式，甚至可以直接从其他生物身上吸取玛娜。

This is why, under the orders of the previous Demon Lord, the Dypal were organized for war and marched out of the Dragonmaw Peaks and into Al-nhamli. Centuries of war would follow, with skirmishes off and on where, were the demon armies ever to prevail in battle, horror stories of whole clans abducted and dragged to the north, or the bodies of the dead feasted upon after battle, would spread. When the Kriterran empire crossed the Flow and found their lost cousins living in Nham, they would soon realize the existential crisis demonkind posed to all of Vaira and join the war.

这就是为什么在前任魔王的命令下，Dypal 组织起来参战，并走出龙喉峰进入阿尔纳姆利。几个世纪的战争将接踵而至，在恶魔军队在战斗中获胜的地方，整个部落被绑架并拖到北方的恐怖故事，或者战后死者的尸体被大快朵颐的恐怖故事都会传播开来。当 Kriterran 帝国越过 The Flow 并发现他们迷失的表亲住在 Nham 时，他们很快就会意识到恶魔对整个 Vaira 构成的生存危机并加入了战争。

The last major battle of the war for Hellgate was a century ago, ending in the death of the former Demon Lord. The Dypal retreated north and were not heard from for nearly a decade. When they returned it was not with violence, but with envoys. The new ruler of Hyirzm declared that he did not wish to follow the path of his father, and explained that the first of his kind who arrived in Vaira were addled with the sights and sounds of the new world, all but driven to madness and insatiable hunger. Having adapted and learned, he would offer a hand in peace instead.

炼狱之门战争的最后一场重大战役是一个世纪前，以前恶魔领主的死亡而告终。Dypal 向北撤退，近十年来杳无音讯。当他们回来时，不是用暴力，而是用使者。海尔兹姆的新统治者宣布他不想走他父亲的道路，并解释说，他第一批到达瓦拉的同类被新世界的景象和声音所笼罩，几乎被逼得发疯和贪得无厌的饥饿。在适应和学习之后，他会伸出援助之手。

While the city of Nham has never formally accepted the peace treaty, citing atrocities of the past, the Kriterran Empire has since been in diplomatic talks with the people of Hyirzm. The concept of trade was, initially, a foreign one to the Dypal. Their world simply didn’t have any. The demons are born into their roles and, should the Demon Lord wish for something, it was brought to them. The idea of purchasing food, or other items, by exchanging goods was a unique novelty and the Demon Lord would have his advisors work tirelessly to determine what could be done to acquire a broader range of mana sources from Vaira, especially food.

虽然 Nham 市以过去的暴行为由从未正式接受和平条约，但 Kriterran 帝国此后一直在与 Hyirzm 人民进行外交谈判。最初，贸易的概念对 Dypal 来说是一个陌生的概念。他们的世界根本就没有。恶魔天生就属于他们的角色，如果恶魔领主想要什么，它就会被带到他们面前。通过交换商品购买食物或其他物品的想法是一种独特的新奇事物，恶魔领主会让他的顾问不知疲倦地工作，以确定可以做些什么来从 Vaira 获得更广泛的玛娜来源，尤其是食物。

Succubi were key to these efforts, serving as agents across Vaira. The succubi with their natural charm would spread across Vaira, either in disguise or by selling themselves as exotic slaves and servants. It was easy enough to acquire the mana they needed for sustenance from sex and, while out in the world, they would gather information. Whether it be as simple as the local cuisine they had tried or as complex as the racial factionalism in a given city, they would slowly relay this information back to Hyirzm.

Succubi 是这些努力的关键，在 Vaira 担任代理。具有自然魅力的魅魔会遍布 Vaira，要么是伪装，要么是将自己卖为异国情调的奴隶和仆人。从性中获得维持生计所需的法力很容易，而且在外面的时候，他们会收集信息。无论是他们尝试过的当地美食，还是特定城市的种族派系斗争等复杂，他们都会慢慢地将这些信息传回给 Hyirzm。

The Demon Lord could thus build the first trading post between his people and the Vairans, situated near Hellgate, but far enough that the mana leakage would not harm the Vairan merchants. Rumors would be spread by succubi agents about this post where even simple things such as fruits and vegetables would fetch high prices and, before long, brave merchants would make the difficult journey there to peddle their wares.

因此，恶魔领主可以在炼狱之门附近建造他的人民和瓦兰人之间的第一个贸易站，但要足够远，以至于玛娜泄漏不会伤害到 Vaira 商人。魅魔代理人会散布关于这个帖子的谣言，即使是水果和蔬菜等简单的东西也会卖高价，不久之后，勇敢的商人就会长途跋涉到那里兜售他们的商品。

This plan has met with great success, with Kriterran alchemists scrambling to buy even jars of dirt from Hyirzm thanks to its inherently high mana density. Even with Nham’s hostile stance towards demonkind, their marketplaces occasionally sell wares originating from Hellgate. Only a fool would pass up those kinds of profits in the desert city, after all.

这个计划取得了巨大的成功，Kriterran 炼金术士争先恐后地从 Hyirzm 购买几罐泥土，这要归功于它固有的高玛娜密度。即使 Nham 对恶魔持敌对立场，他们的市场偶尔也会出售源自 Hellgate 的商品。毕竟，只有傻子才会在沙漠之城放弃这些利润。

## **Zev**

### **The Plains** -平原

The Zev of the plains are split along family and tribal groups, with the dominant tribes of the Plains being the Steelfang, Sunfoot, and the Bloody Claw. Each of these major tribes controls large swaths of territory in the Steel Plains, with smaller, weaker tribes acting as tribal vassals, of a sort. 

Zev 平原按家庭和部落群体划分，平原的主要部落是 Steelfang(钢铁之牙)、Sunfoot(太阳之足) 和 Bloody Claw(血腥之爪)。这些主要部落中的每一个都控制着钢铁平原的大片领土，较小、较弱的部落在某种程度上充当部落附庸。

The Sunfoot control territory in the northern plains, near the border with the Al-Nhamli desert, and are the plains Zev most amenable to outsiders. While still fiercely territorial, the Sunfoot often send their young warriors to Nham to prove themselves in the colosseum, and are thus often encountered on friendlier terms than if one were to trespass on their territory. Nham regularly hires Sunfoot warriors as mercenaries and caravan guards in exchange for arms and armor, making the Sunfoot the best equipped of the three Great Tribes.

Sunfoot 控制着北部平原的领土，靠近 Al-Nhamli 沙漠的边界，是 Zev 最容易接受外人的平原。虽然太阳脚族仍然具有强烈的领土意识，但他们经常将他们的年轻战士送到 Nham 在斗兽场中证明自己，因此经常以比侵入他们的领土更友好的条件遇到他们。Nham 定期雇佣 Sunfoot 战士作为雇佣兵和商队守卫，以换取武器和盔甲，使 Sunfoot 成为三大部落中装备最好的部落。

The Steelfang tribe is located in the central plains and is the largest of all the tribes. The Steelfang likewise control the largest number of vassal tribes. They often war with the Sunfoot and the Bloody Claw, but have thus far been unable to conquer either tribe thanks to the last member of the triad attacking Steelfang lands from the opposite direction, which keeps the balance between the three tribes, as both the Sunfoot and Bloody Claw know they would lose a direct, one on one confrontation.

Steelfang 位于中原，是所有部落中最大的。Steelfang 同样控制着数量最多的封臣部落。他们经常与 Sunfoot 和Bloody Claw 交战，但到目前为止无法征服任何一个部落，这要归功于三合会的最后一名成员从相反的方向攻击 Steelfang 的土地，这保持了三个部落之间的平衡，因为 Sunfoot 和 Bloody Claw 都知道他们会失去一个直接的， 一对一的对抗。

The Bloody Claw are relatively isolationist, controlling the southern parts of the plains closer to the Deepwoods. The smallest of the three Great Tribes, the Bloody Claw makes up for their numbers with bloody-minded ferocity. While the Sunfoot often wear Nham-made armor and wield well-crafted weapons and the Steelfang have numbers and strength on their side, the Bloody Claw specialize in ambush and shock tactics, using the hillier scrubland of the south to their advantage.

Bloody Claw 相对孤立，控制着更靠近深林的平原南部。Bloody Claw 是三大部落中最小的一个，以血腥的凶猛弥补了他们的人数。虽然 Sunfoot 经常穿着 Nham 制造的盔甲并挥舞着精心制作的武器，而 Steelfang 拥有人数和力量，而 Bloody Claw 则擅长伏击和电击战术，利用南方的丘陵灌木丛来发挥自己的优势。

All Zev tribes of the plains share a warrior culture that advocates strength and cunning as the greatest and most desirable traits. Weakness is to be abhorred, and uselessness to be despised. Thus, all adult Zev are expected to be able warriors with pregnant females and young children the only allowed exceptions. A Zev should not grow old and feeble, but die in glorious battle before that can ever happen. 

平原上的所有 Zev 部落都拥有一种战士文化，他们认为力量和狡猾是最伟大和最令人向往的特质。软弱是可憎的，无用是鄙视的。因此，所有成年 Zev 都应该能够作战 怀孕的女性和年幼的孩子是唯一允许的例外。Zev 不应该变老和虚弱，而是在那之前就死在光荣的战斗中。

Zev are also expected to find mates outside their own tribe, which is one motivator for the tribal warfare across the plains. Young warriors will go to battle with members of other tribes and, if they are victorious, may claim one or more as mates, though only strong potential mates would be desired. With adolescent warriors battling this way, it’s not unusual for a frantic melee to break down into an impromptu orgy before it ends, and the cultural fascination with both sex and violence, along with Zev’s naturally high sex drive, causes most plains Zev to become visibly aroused in battle and spend hours afterwards mating until exhaustion, a trait that has become quite popular in Nham’s colosseum events.

Zev 还被期望在自己的部落之外找到配偶，这是平原上部落战争的一个动机。年轻的战士将与其他部落的成员一起战斗，如果他们获胜，可能会要求一个或多个作为配偶，尽管只需要强大的潜在伴侣。随着青少年战士以这种方式战斗，疯狂的混战在结束前分解成即兴狂欢并不罕见，对性和暴力的文化迷恋，以及 Zev 天生的高性欲，导致大多数平原 Zev 在战斗中变得明显兴奋，并在之后花费数小时交配直到筋疲力尽， 这一特征在 Nham 的罗马斗兽场活动中变得非常流行。

Zev tribes are led by a Tribal Chief. The Chief is expected to be the greatest warrior of their tribe, and the Chiefdom is rarely inherited. Instead, an aspiring warrior may challenge the current Chief to a ceremonial duel and, if victorious, will take their place. While the Zev expect women to fight, they do not allow women to become Chief, as if they become pregnant they will be unable to lead in battle.

Zev 部落由部落酋长领导。酋长被认为是他们部落中最伟大的战士，而酋长领地很少被继承。相反，一个有抱负的战士可以挑战现任酋长进行仪式决斗，如果获胜，将取代他们的位置。虽然 Zev 希望女性参战，但他们不允许女性成为酋长，因为如果她们怀孕了，她们将无法在战斗中领导。

### **The Deepwoods**-深黑森林

The Zev tribes of the Deepwoods have developed a vastly different culture than their plains-dwelling kin. Historical records of Kriterran scholars considered them completely separate species for hundreds of years, and it is not difficult to see why. Forest Zev are, by and large, not confrontational people. Indeed, most of the tribes dotted across the forest have never even been seen by outsiders, their treetop villages well hidden from prying eyes. Many tribes are known only as names provided to scholars by the Brighthearth tribe.

深黑森林的 Zev 部落已经发展出一种与他们居住在平原上的亲戚截然不同的文化。数百年来，Kriterran 学者的历史记录认为它们是完全独立的物种，不难看出原因。总的来说，Forest Zev 不是对抗性的人。事实上，散布在森林中的大多数部落甚至从未被外人看到过，他们的树梢村庄很好地隐藏起来，不被窥探。许多部落仅以 Brighthearth 部落提供给学者的名字而闻名。

The many tribes across the forest form a loose federation, with no direct leader or executive authority. Instead, in times of crisis, runners will be sent across the forest to meet with tribal elders and chiefs to form a council by which all the tribes of the forest can be directed towards a single purpose. This was, apparently, last performed when Kriterran ships landed on the shores of the Deepwood some two centuries ago.

森林中的许多部落组成了一个松散的联盟，没有直接的领导者或执行机构。相反，在危机时期，跑步者将被派往森林中，与部落长老和酋长会面，以组成一个委员会，通过该委员会，森林中的所有部落都可以朝着一个目标前进。显然，这是大约两个世纪前 Kriterran 船只登陆深林海岸时最后一次表演。

Apart from these emergency meetings, the tribes generally rely upon eachother for trade and supplies, with different tribes specialized in providing food and goods to others in exchange for what they need in return. The Brighthearth serve as the only tribe that trades with the outside world, and thus is the point of contact for the entire Deepwood and any goods from outside of it that are needed.

除了这些紧急会议外，部落通常相互依赖进行贸易和补给，不同的部落专门向其他人提供食物和商品，以换取他们所需的回报。Brighthearth 是唯一与外部世界进行贸易的部落，因此是整个 Deepwood 和任何来自外部需要的货物的联系点。

Because of how important the Brighthearth has become in the centuries since their first contact with outsiders, it has grown to become the largest of the Deepwood Zev tribes. They are quite hospitable to visitors, and, with some knowledge from Kriterran architects, even created a great lift to ferry men and supplies from the shores of the World’s End up to Brighthearth, the treetop capital.

由于自从他们第一次与外人接触以来的几个世纪里，Brighthearth 变得如此重要，它已经发展成为 Deepwood Zev 部落中最大的部落。他们对游客非常友好，并且凭借 Kriterran 建筑师的一些知识，甚至建造了一条很棒的电梯，将人员和物资从 World's End 的海岸运送到树梢之都 Brighthearth。

While the Brighthearth have ever refused to give much in the way of detail on other tribes for the sake of protecting their lands and privacy, they’re perfectly willing to speak of themselves and their own customs. The Brighthearth are led by a High Shaman. Candidates for this role must have very strong ties to their guardian spirits, and are often groomed for the role from birth, as it is the High Shaman who inspects every newborn Zev of the tribe to determine who their guardian spirit is.

虽然 Brighthearth 为了保护他们的土地和隐私而拒绝透露其他部落的太多细节，但他们完全愿意谈论他们自己和他们自己的习俗。Brighthearth 由一位高级萨满领导。这个角色的候选人必须与他们的守护神有非常紧密的联系，并且通常从出生起就被培养成这个角色，因为是高级萨满检查部落中每个新生的 Zev，以确定他们的守护神是谁。

These spirits are said to be the Zev’s own ancestors in animal form and all Zev are said to have one. However, only the Shamans are said to be close enough to their spirits to summon their aid directly. Indeed, the Zev seem to be predisposed to summoning magic, though it is unclear if these truly are the spirits of their ancestors or simply conjured creatures based upon their beliefs.

据说这些灵魂是 Zev 自己的动物形式的祖先，据说所有 Zev 都有一个。然而，据说只有萨满足够接近他们的灵魂，可以直接召唤他们的帮助。事实上，Zev 似乎倾向于召唤魔法，尽管目前尚不清楚这些真的是他们祖先的灵魂，还是仅仅根据他们的信仰召唤出的生物。

As a result of the increasing frequency of visitors from outside the Deepwoods, many young Zev from Brighthearth have begun to venture into the outside world, with Kriterra hosting the largest population of Zev immigrants.

由于来自 Deepwoods 以外的游客越来越频繁，许多来自 Brighthearth 的年轻 Zev 开始冒险进入外面的世界，其中 Kriterra 接待了最多的 Zev 移民。
