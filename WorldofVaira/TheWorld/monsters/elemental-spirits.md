## ELEMENTAL SPIRITS-元素之灵

Elemental Spirits are creatures that, in the modern day, are exceedingly hard to find. From surviving records and myths it can be inferred they were relatively common in the age of myth, and were said to be the children of various gods who, themselves, were the children of Vaira. Elemental Spirits can take on many shapes and forms and are often associated with different aspects of nature, though they can also represent more abstract or modern concepts such as ‘happiness’ or ‘wealth’. Across both Kriterra and Apteros there are temple ruins devoted to various spirits that were thought to be guardians or local demigods, however these beings themselves seem to be largely absent. The High Elves supposedly maintain contact with the guardian fae spirits of the forest and the Dwarves are said to be descended from spirits of Earth, but as to where the majority of these spirits have gone, none can truly say. Perhaps they simply left.

元素之灵是现代极难找到的生物。从幸存的记录和神话中可以推断出他们在神话时代相对常见，据说是各种神的孩子，而这些神本身就是 Vaira 的孩子。元素之灵可以有多种形状和形式，并且通常与自然的不同方面有关，尽管它们也可以代表更抽象或现代的概念，例如“幸福”或“财富”。在 Kriterra 和 Apteros 都有供奉各种灵魂的寺庙废墟，这些灵魂被认为是守护者或当地的半神，但这些生物本身似乎基本上不存在。据说高等精灵与森林的守护精灵保持联系，据说矮人是地球精灵的后裔，但至于这些精灵中的大多数都去了哪里，没有人能真正说出来。也许他们只是离开了。
