## MAN-MADE CREATURES-人造混血

The world of Vaira is full of an abundance of life, but some creatures are distinctly unnatural. These creatures are often the result of magical experiments, such as the many tentacles that dwell now within the Slimy Forest. Other creations are artificial chimeras, such as Mahogany’s experiment LZ-19. Some are as simple as enchanted objects to provide them a degree of thought and mobility, such as golems, whereas others could be normal animals given intelligence or other properties. These beings are almost universally the product of mages and their research.

Vaira 的世界充满了丰富的生命，但有些生物显然是非自然的。这些生物通常是魔法实验的结果，例如现在居住在 Slimy Forest 中的许多触手。其他创作是人造嵌合体，例如 Mahogany 的实验 LZ-19。有些就像附魔物体一样简单，为它们提供一定程度的思维和机动性，例如傀儡，而另一些可能是具有智力或其他属性的普通动物。这些生物几乎都是法师和他们研究的产物。
