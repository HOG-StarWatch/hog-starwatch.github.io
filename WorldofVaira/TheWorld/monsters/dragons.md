## DRAGONS-龙

Dragons are considered to be the greatest of all magical beasts. They are incredibly intelligent and ageless beings that take the form of great winged reptiles and are said to have existed for as long as the world of Vaira itself has. The mountains of Apteros, back when they were still known as the Maw of Dragons, were once home to the majority of dragonkind. When the Hellgate was inadvertently created in times past, the massive outflow of mana from the demon’s homeworld killed or warped much of the life in the area. While dragons themselves are resistant to mana corruption, most were forced to migrate to find more suitable nesting and hunting grounds. When dragons first arrived in Kriterra they were thought of as horrific beasts and great hunts were organized with knights and mages to slay any dragons that had taken up residence near human or elven lands, as the elves were no less wary of the new arrivals.

龙被认为是所有魔法野兽中最伟大的。它们是非常聪明和不老的生物，以巨大的有翼爬行动物的形式出现，据说与 Vaira 世界本身一样存在。Apteros 的山脉，当它们还被称为龙之喉时，曾经是大多数龙族的家园。当炼狱之门在过去无意中被创造出来时，从恶魔的母星中大量流出的法力杀死或扭曲了该地区的大部分生物。虽然龙本身对法术力腐化有抵抗力，但大多数龙被迫迁徙以寻找更合适的筑巢和狩猎地。当龙第一次到达 Kriterra 时，它们被认为是可怕的野兽，骑士和法师组织了大规模的狩猎活动，以杀死任何居住在人类或精灵土地附近的龙，因为精灵对新来者同样警惕。

In the East, the lizardmen of the desert already had the occasional dealings with dragonkind in the past and the few that moved into the great desert caused them little concern. Some of the humans that had taken up residence in the region during the Great War in the west would come to worship those selfsame dragons as guardian spirits. These same human tribes in modern days consider themselves to have been blessed with the blood of dragons, which allows them to thrive in the harsh conditions of Al-Nhamli compared to the ‘softskins’ who dwell in the city of Nham and its satellite villages.

在东方，沙漠中的蜥蜴人过去已经偶尔与龙族打交道，而少数进入大沙漠的蜥蜴人并没有引起他们的担忧。一些在西部大战期间居住在该地区的人类会来崇拜那些相同的龙作为守护神。现代的这些人类部落认为自己拥有龙的血液，与居住在 Nham 市及其卫星村庄的“软皮”相比，这使他们能够在 Al-Nhamli 的恶劣条件下茁壮成长。

Tales of dragons crop up further south as well: The plains Zev have myths about great beasts that feasted upon the herd animals that the tribes traditionally hunt. In the forests there are stories about shadows from great birds cast across the Deepwoods. However, despite the common presence of myths about dragonkind, one thing is quite clear: The population of dragons has fallen immensely after their forced migration. Competing with the settled races for food, and dwelling in areas less suited for their physiology than the great mountains, it seems that the dragon race is doomed to slowly dwindle out of existence, like many other races from the age of myths.

更南边也出现了关于龙的故事：Zev 平原上有关于大型野兽的神话，这些野兽以部落传统上狩猎的群居动物为食。在森林中，有关于大鸟在深林中投下的影子的故事。然而，尽管关于龙族的神话普遍存在，但有一点是很清楚的：龙的数量在被迫迁徙后已经大幅下降。与定居的种族争夺食物，并且居住在比大山更不适合他们生理的地区，龙族似乎注定要慢慢消失，就像神话时代的许多其他种族一样。
