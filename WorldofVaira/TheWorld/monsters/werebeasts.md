## WEREBEASTS-野兽

Werebeasts categorize a large variety of ‘humanoid monsters’ such as werewolves, minotaurs, berserkers, treemen, and so on. As a result of their diversity, this term serves more as a catchall than a true classification. There are many theories regarding the origins of different werebeasts. For example the werewolf has several competing theories as to its origin. Legends state that werewolves and other werebeasts are humans or elves who were cursed by the goddess Vaira and can spread their curse by biting another individual. Another theory states that they are a long-lost and feral Zev tribe that has regressed into a beastial state. Yet another theory concludes that werewolves were created by a magical experiment in the Age of Myth which has gone on to reproduce. Other werebeasts have similarly conflicting theories on their own origins, from plants infused with life by an elemental spirit to the result of mana corruption. The major commonality between all Werebeasts, however, is a sensitivity to magic and mana and a greater intelligence, or perhaps cunning, than ‘normal’ animals.

Werebeasts 将各种各样的“人形怪物”归类，例如狼人、牛头怪、狂战士、树人等。由于它们的多样性，这个术语更像是一个包罗万象，而不是一个真正的分类。关于不同 werebeasts 的起源有很多理论。例如，关于狼人的起源，有几种相互竞争的理论。传说中，狼人和其他野兽是被女神 Vaira 诅咒的人类或精灵，可以通过咬另一个人来传播他们的诅咒。另一种理论指出，他们是一个失落已久的野蛮 Zev 部落，已经退化为野兽状态。然而，另一种理论得出结论，狼人是由神话时代的一个魔法实验创造的，该实验后来继续繁殖。其他兽人对自己的起源也有类似的冲突理论，从元素精灵注入生命的植物到法术力腐化的结果。然而，所有 Werebeasts 之间的主要共同点是对魔法和法力的敏感性，以及比“正常”动物更聪明，或者可能更狡猾。
